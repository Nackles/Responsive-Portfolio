# Responsive-Portfolio

This is a copy of my basicportfolio with @media queries to resize at 980px, 768px, and 640px.

#Notes on initial push
I feel like I understand exactly what it is the media queries are doing, unfortunately my initial code still needs work and that work is interfering with the media queries effectiveness. It seems probable that just fixing it with a media query active will solve its desktop-first problems simultaneously, but as my brain is informing me I have reached the point of diminishing returns for staring at code today and I need to continue my sleep cycle to be ready for class tomorrow.

When I do have free moments before or after class or especially on weekends I want to come back and tinker with this code and make the responsive layout *work* - if only because it's going to bug me (haha) until it does. This might be something I will want help with - but I want to take another crack at it with the skills I've developed since creating the initial site first.
